## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass
- Block Element Modifier (BEM)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - npm

### What I learned

I learned how to use the picture tag in conjunction with the scoure and img tags to load different images based on the visitor's viewport for this project. I ran into problems using srcset with only the img tag, where the images weren't loading and then didn't come in at the correct breakpoint, so I looked for other solutions. I found solutions using javascript and background images, but I didn't want to use them because I wanted to keep the project as simple as possible.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [Load images based on screen size](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23414817/load-images-based-on-screen-size) - This helped me for loading images based on viewport width. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward as it doesn't require any javascript.
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) - This is the package library for node, which contains all of the devdependencies. I'd recommend it to anyone who is still learning to use Node to build websites, whether in teams or on their own.
- [Minimum Static Site Setup with Sass](https://thinkdobecreate.com/articles/minimum-static-site-sass-setup/) - This is the package.json template used as a good start for setting up a dev environment.
